a. This is not a Strategy design pattern. Because the context graph doesn't benefit from different algorithm.
　　There is only one algorithm works in Command for every different graph.
b. This is a Composite design pattern. Because the CommandSequence is Command itself. When the do and undo method is called, CommandSequence will call each element's do method in order and undo method in reverse order, and combine the result.
