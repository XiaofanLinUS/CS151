It would be better to use a tool that doesn't draw incorrect sequence diagrams. Look at the timeline in MailSystem. You can't have an unbroken timeline with multiple calls into it. Same for the User timeline.

You should use the correct method names. keepIt and erase aren't methods of your MailSystem class.

The getMailbox method does NOT call getCurrentMessage or saveCurrentMessage, but that's what you are indicating in your diagram.
