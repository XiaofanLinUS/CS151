    <h3>Exam Problems</h3>

    <ol><li>[10 points] Draw an UML sequence diagram of the first call to <code>oddSquares.next()</code> in my test case <code>NumberSequenceTest.filterTest</code> of homework 4. You may trace through your or my solution—tell me which in a note on your diagram. Submit it on paper or in a file <code>sequence.png</code> in your <code>exam1</code> directory.</li>
      <li>[8 points] Draw an UML class diagram of the classes and interfaces in the solution of homework 5. Indicate multiplicities as appropriate. You may use your or my solution—tell me which in a note on your diagram. Submit it on paper or in a file <code>hw5class.png</code> in your <code>exam1</code> directory.</li>
      <li>[15 points] In homework 2b, the message text in the <code>Message</code> class was a <code>String</code> object. Change it to an interface <code>Text</code> with a single method to get the content. Supply two classes <code>PlainText</code> and <code>OneTimeText</code> that implement this interface. A <code>OneTimeText</code> message can be read once, and afterwards it yields an empty string. Make the appropriate changes so that a <code>Message</code> has a <code>Text</code> object, and so that its <code>getText</code> method returns the contents. Change the user interface so that, after the user has selected the <code>[S]end message</code> menu option, a menu
        <pre>[P]lain text  [O]ne time text</pre>
        is displayed, and construct a message with one or the other kind of text.</li>
      <li>[10 points] Consider <a href='Length.java'>this class</a> that represents units in feet and inches. Change the internal representation to use only inches, without affecting clients of the class.</li>
      <li>[8 points] As you can see from <a href='FileChooserDemo.java'>this program</a>, you can restrict the files that are displayed in a <code>JFileChooser</code> by passing a class that implements <code>FileFilter</code>. Make a table similar to those in Section 5.4.3 of your textbook to show why this is an example of the STRATEGY pattern. Submit as a plain text file <code>strategy.txt</code>.</li>
