Those back arrows are wrong. For example, getGreeting does not call mailboxMenu on a Console instance.

This doesn't look like you used a sequence diagram tool.

The getMessage arrow from Mailbox to Console can't be right. There is no getMessage method in your Console class.

The Erase call from the Console to the Mailbox is wrong.

The timeline of the mailbox is wrong. You would expect multiple smaller timelines, one for each call.

Don't do those return arrows.

Ok, I'll take this on faith, but it would be more convincing if your program worked as expected.

That doesn't look like it was drawn with a sequence diagram tool.

Your MailSystem doesn't even have a login method.
Your User doesn't have a checkUserPassword class, and its checkPassword method does NOT call checkPassword on the mailbox.

MessageQueue does not call peek on a Message object.

It would be better to use a tool that doesn't draw incorrect sequence diagrams. Look at the timeline in MailSystem. You can't have an unbroken timeline with multiple calls into it. Same for the User timeline.

You should use the correct method names. keepIt and erase aren't methods of your MailSystem class.

The getMailbox method does NOT call getCurrentMessage or saveCurrentMessage, but that's what you are indicating in your diagram.

When I ask for a .png, could you please provide that?

You indicate that a User method calls login on a Console object, but in your User class, there is no such call. You then indicate that Console.login calls User.readMenu, but it actually calls readMenu on itself.

You indicate that a User method calls keep on a Console object, and again there is no such call. Same for erase.

When I first glanced at your diagram, I didn't believe it to be truthful because it doesn't make sense that you already have a User object when the login happens. WHICH user? One first needs to find the right one.

hw2b.txt (max. 5 points): 3

I am looking at your Console class. It is using Mailbox, but your UML diagram for homework 2A indicated that Console doesn't use it. That's a change you should have explained.

The "speak" backwards arrows don't make sense.

You indicate that a Console object calls login on a MailSystem object. But that's not true in your Console.java file.

You indicate that a Console object calls read, keep, and erase on a Mailbox object. But that's not true in your Console.java file.

You indicate that a MessageQueue object calls peek, add, delete, on a Message object. But that's not true in your MessageQueue.java file.

This doesn't look like it's been drawn with a sequence diagram tool.

The left part makes no sense. What do those boxes mean?

The timelines make no sense.

What are those reverse arrows from Message to Mailbox?

You say that you call "use system" on a MailSystem. I see no such call in your Console.java.

The reverse arrows make no sense.

The "send message" self-call in Mailbox makes no sense. And your Mailbox.java has no such call.

In your initial design, a User didn't have a Mailbox. In your solution, it does.

Don't do those reverse arrows. Every method returns its result, and you don't indicate that.

There is an unlabeled self-call in :Connection.

When I first looked at your diagram, I said "this has got to be wrong--what does the Connection know about the new and kept messages? But when I looked at your source code, I saw that's exactly what you implemented. That's not optimal--remember the law of Demeter. That's an advantage of these diagrams. They make it easy to spot such issues.

In your original UML diagram, MailSystem didn't use Message, but now you do.

In your original UML diagram, Mailbox didn't use MessageQueue, but now you do.

This wasn't produced with a sequence diagram tool.

You should not have arrows going backwards.

The MailSystem doesn't make a call "find that user" on a User object.

A User doesn't make a call "find that mailbox" on a Mailbox object.

A Mailbox doesn't make a call "find the message" on a MessageQueue object.

I looked into your MailSystem, User, and Mailbox classes, and none of those calls were there.

You say that the MailSystem calls addUser on a User object. That makes no sense.

What is the unnamed call from User to Mailbox?

Th call to addMessage should be BELOW that call.

And it makes no sense that addMessage is invoked on a Message object.

What is that lonely piece of timeline in MessageQueue?

I like the numbering of the calls. That makes it easy to refer to them.

Your call #2 doesn't start from anywhere. It should start in the timeline of call #1. Same for call #5, 14, 20.

In #7, peek does not call create to create a message.

#15 doesn't call create either.

Message1 and Message2 aren't class or object names.

Your #3 isn't what is happening in your MailSystem.java. You aren't creating a mailbox.

Don't do those backwards arrows.

I see what you are trying to do with the humanUser. But it is confusing since a human is clearly not an object in a programming language, and a human doesn't call methods. That's why I left the human on the side in my diagrams and used the notes to represent the human steps.

You say that a Console object calls the Authenticate method on a MailSystem object, but I looked in your Console class. It doesn't.

You say that a MailSystem object calls the Authenticate method on a User object, but I looked at your MailSystem class. It doesn't.

You say that a MessageQueue object calls the "this one" method on itself, but I looked at your MessageQueue class. It doesn't.
